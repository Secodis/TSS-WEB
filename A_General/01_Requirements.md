# 1. Types of Requirements

By [RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119), two types of requirements are specified in this standard:

- **Mandatory Requirements**: Identified by terms like “MUST“, “MUST NOT”, or “HAVE TO”
- **Recommendations**: Identified by a term like “SHOULD“ or “CAN” In case a requirement has a recommendation like nature, it does not need to be implemented if justifiable reasons exist. Recommendations that are specified with “CAN” are focused on applications of increased protection requirements or risk profile. Exceptions to not complying with mandatory requirements must be approved by the relevant IT security function.

The requirements in this framework are primarily baseline requirements, suitable for all applications and services. Additionally, there are a few requirements specifically for more critical applications. These requirements often demand more effort to implement and address risks that may not be significant for all applications. To differentiate these, we use the term [assurance class]({{site.URL_GENERAL_ASSURANCECLASSES}}).
