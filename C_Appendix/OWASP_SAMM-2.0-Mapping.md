# OWASP SAMM 2.0 Mapping

TSS-WEB 2.0 generally covers a large number of OWASP SAMM 2.0 security practices, especially from maturity level 1 & 2. We’ve added additional requirements to TSS-WEB where this was possible. However, the scope of TSS-WEB is another as OWASP SAMM. 

Whereas TSS-WEB describes a security dev standard for particular development units, OWASP SAMM focuses on the entire organization. Therefore, organization-wide tasks that have to be done by the IT security government function and that are therefore mostly within business function Governance are not covered in TSS-WEB. Also, whereas TSS-WEB describes a robust enterprise standard, OWASP SAMM provides three level of maturity for all objectives.

TSS-WEB can be helpful for implementing a large number of requirements (= those that affect the dev organization) of OWASP SAMM.
