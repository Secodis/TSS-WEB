# 2. Remediation of Vulnerabilities in Production

Identified vulnerabilities in applications MUST generally be remediated quickly and causative. In case root case remediation should require a significant amount of time and the risk posed by the vulnerability is also significant, temporary measures (e.g. workarounds) SHOULD be implemented to reduce the exploitability as soon as possible until the actual root cause is fixed. Such remediation MUST always be considered as a temporary measure.

In respect of external (e.g. Internet-facing) applications, the following requirements define the point of time until a vulnerability MUST be corrected, or its exploitability prevented latest:

|| **Critical Vuln** | **High Vuln**  | **Moderate Vuln**  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Critical App** | Within 7 days  | Within the next release, but after 6 months at the latest. |
| **Non-Critical App** | Within 7 days  | Within 21 days  | - |

In respect of internal applications, the following requirements define the point of time until a vulnerability MUST be remediated if possible or at least its exploitability prevented:

| | **Critical Vuln**  | **High Vuln** | **Moderate Vuln** |
| -------------| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Critical App** | Within 7 days  | Within 30 days  | Within the next release, but after 12 months at the latest. |
| **Non-Critical App**| Within 21 days  | Within 60 days  | - |
