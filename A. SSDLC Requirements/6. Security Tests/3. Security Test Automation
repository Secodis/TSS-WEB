1. Applications MUST be automatically analyzed with security code scanning tools (SAST or IAST) in order to identify implementation vulnerabilities in source and program code as early as possible.
2. Applications MUST be automatically analyzed with SCA (Software Composition Analysis) tools for any known vulnerabilities in 3rd party dependencies.
3. Docker images used in the target production environment MUST be automatically scanned for security issues.
4. Security-relevant configuration MUST be automatically scanned for security issues.
5. For applications with assurance class >= [HIGH] Security testing tools MUST automatically enforce security requirements and security testing policies within the build process as specified at 5. Security within Software Development Process.
6. Applications with assurance class [VERY HIGH] SHOULD be periodically tested for denial-of-service attackability.
