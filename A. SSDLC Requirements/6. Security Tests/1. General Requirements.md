1. Correct and complete implementation of security & security-relevant requirements and changes MUST be verified with suitable security tests.
2. Where possible, security tests SHOULD be executed automatically and continuously (e.g. within CI and CD pipelines) and as early as possible within the development process (fail fast principle).
3. Test data MUST not contain confidential or personal (PII data) references.
4. The execution of security tests MUST NOT be affected by perimetric security systems (e.g. a web application firewall).
