Administrative access MUST be as restricted as possible:

1. Applications that are directly accessible from the Internet (or other untrusted networks) MUST be deployed in an isolated network zone.
2. All external communication MUST be encrypted using TLS/HTTPS.
3. All external access to internal network zones MUST be approved.
4. Outgoing communication (egress) to the Internet MUST be restricted and SHOULD be handled by proxies (e.g. HTTP proxies or SMTP proxies).
5. Incoming communication (ingress) SHOULD be handled by reverse proxies (e.g. API gateways, Web gateways).
6. A web application firewall (WAF) MAY be used here, e.g. as an additional layer of protection, for virtual patching or as an application IDS.
