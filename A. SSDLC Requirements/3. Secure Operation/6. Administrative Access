2. Username “admin” should not be used.
3. Limited to internal network zones or authorized IPs if possible.
4. Using a mandatory 2nd authentication factor (such as hardware tokens, authenticator apps, X.509 client certificates) in combination with a strong user password.
5. All administrative access should be logged in a tamperproof way.
6. Immediately revoked after they are not required anymore (e.g. user changes organizational role).
