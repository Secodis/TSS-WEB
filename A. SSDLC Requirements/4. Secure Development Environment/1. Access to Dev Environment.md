Securing access to the dev environment:

1. Access to development systems (incl. and build and deployment systems) MUST be sufficiently protected.
2. Access to development environment MUST be restricted.
3. Remote access to development systems MUST only be possible via a secure VPN connection and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
