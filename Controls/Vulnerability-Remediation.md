# A.6 - Vulnerability Remediation

1. Identified vulnerabilities in productive applications MUST generally be remediated quickly and effectively.
2. In cases where root cause remediation requires a significant amount of time and the risk posed by the vulnerability is also significant, temporary measures (e.g., workarounds) SHOULD be implemented to reduce exploitability as soon as possible until the actual root cause is fixed.
3.Vulnerabilities in productive applications and services MUST be remediated, or its exploitability prevented, within following point of time.

Internet-facing applications or services:

| | **Critical Vulnerability** | **High Vulnerability**  | **Moderate Vulnerability**  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Critical Application** | At the end of the **next working day** |  Within **7 days** | Within the next release, but after **6 months** at the latest. |
| **Non-Critical Application** | Within **7 days**  | Within **21 days** | - |

Internal applications or services:

| | **Critical Vulnerability**  | **High Vulnerability** | **Moderate Vulnerability** |
| -------------| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Critical Application** | Within **7 days**  | Within **30 days**  | Within the next release, but after **12 months** at the latest. |
| **Non-Critical Application**| Within **21 days**  | Within **60 days**  | - |
