# B.10 - Data Security

## {{site.TITLE_IMPL_DATASEC_GENERAL}}

Only standard and mature cryptographic algorithms, operation modes, key lengths ciphers, and implementations MUST be used.

## {{site.TITLE_IMPL_DATASEC_ENCRYPT-TANSIT}}

1. All external communication MUST only be possile via TLS/HTTPS.
2. In cases where access requires HTTPS, requests via HTTP MUST be redirected to HTTPS. This SHOULD be implemented with a permanent redirection (HTTP 301).
3. HTTPS servers MUST only support current secure ciphers and protocols. Insecure or deprecated ones (e.g. SSLv2, TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1 and RC4 cipher) MUST be deactivated [^1].
4. External Websites MUST receive at least an "A" rating from the SSL Labs Server Test[^2]. Internal Websites SHOULD use another test tool to verify their settings.
5. Confidential data MUST only be sent within the HTTP request body (e.g. via HTTP POST) or header but not within URLs.
6. Transmission on untrusted channels (e.g. the Internet) MUST
    - only be possible with HTTPS using valid certificates.
    - using HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers and
    - only be sent with anti-caching response headers (see [{{site.TITLE_MATERIAL_SECHEADER}}]({{site.URL_MATERIAL_SECHEADER}})).

## {{site.TITLE_IMPL_DATASEC_CERTS}}

1. External HTTPS connections MUST use valid X.509 certificates issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA).
2. X.509 certificates MUST use RSA with at least 3072 bit or ECDSAÂ with at least 256 bit keys[^4].
3. External customer applications (UIs) SHOULD use Extended Validation (EV) certificates.
4. Wildcard certificated MUST not be used.

## {{site.TITLE_IMPL_DATASEC_ENCRYPT-REST}}

1. Confidential data MUST be encrypted before stored.
2. Access to encryption keys MUST be handles according to the requirements specified in [{{site.TITLE_IMPL_SECRETS}}]({{site.URL_IMPL_SECRETS}})
3. Only secure algorithms MUST be used for encryption[^3].
4. User passwords MUST be persisted according to requirements at [{{site.TITLE_IMPL_USERPASSWD}}]({{site.URL_IMPL_USERPASSWD}}).

## {{site.TITLE_IMPL_DATASEC_INTEGRITY}}

1. Security-sensitive integrity validation MUST be performed using either cryptographic hash functions (e.g. sha256 or hmac-sha256)[^5] or using public key cryptography[^4][^7].
2. Integrity validation within a distributed architecture (aka "data authentication") SHOULD utilize public key cryptography rather than HMACs, particularly when a secret key would otherwise be shared among multiple systems.

## {{site.TITLE_IMPL_DATASEC_TOKENS}}

1. Tokens (or keys) that are used for security purposes (e.g. access tokens, passwords of technical users, or API keys) MUST be cryptographically random and at least 256 bit (= 32 character) lenght[^6].
2. Non-opaque tokens MUST be signed using preferably public key cryptography or cryptographic hash functions (see above).
